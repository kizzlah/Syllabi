# Syllabi

An open-source AI-powered chatbot platform with advanced knowledge base integration, multi-modal support, and seamless integrations.
## 🤝 Looking for Maintainers

I'm starting a new job and won't have bandwidth to actively maintain this. **If you're interested in helping maintain this project**, here's how:

**Start contributing:**
- Submit quality PRs
- Help triage issues
- Improve documentation
- Review other people's PRs (even without merge rights, reviews are valuable!)

**Then just ask:**
If you've made meaningful contributions and want write access to help maintain the project, just open an issue or comment saying so. I'm happy to add contributors who show they understand the codebase and want to help.

**No formal process, no committee, no bureaucracy.** Just good vibes and good code. ✌️

**Or fork it!** If you want to take the project in a different direction or I'm not responsive enough, forking is totally fine. That's the beauty of open source.

- OpenAI API key
- Redis (for backend task queue)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Achu-shankar/Syllabi.git
cd syllabi
```

2. **Setup Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your credentials
npm run dev
```

3. **Setup Backend** (Optional - for document processing)
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

4. **Setup Database**

**Option 1: Quick Setup with Schema File (Recommended)**

Create a Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com), then run the complete schema:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Open `frontend/supabase/schema.sql` file
3. Copy the entire contents
4. Paste into SQL Editor and click "Run"

This will create all tables, indexes, RLS policies, and functions in one go.

**Option 2: Using Supabase CLI**
```bash
cd frontend
supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref
supabase db push
```

**Option 3: Individual Migration Files**
- Run SQL files from `frontend/supabase/migrations/` one by one
- Useful for understanding incremental changes during development
